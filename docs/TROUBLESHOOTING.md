## API and Network Issues

### "Network request failed"

## Common Error Messages

### "Invalid prop style supplied to React.Fragment"

- **Doesn't affect functionality** - video chat still works
- **Can be ignored** - it's a known issue with the current version
- **Will be fixed** in future 100ms SDK updates

### "WebRTC connection failed"
- **Check network connectivity** - WebRTC needs stable connection
- **Verify firewall settings** - some networks block WebRTC
- **Check STUN/TURN servers** - ensure 100ms can establish connection
- **Try different network** - mobile vs WiFi

### "Device not supported"
- **Check device requirements** - iOS 13+ / Android 6+
- **Verify camera/microphone** - ensure hardware is working
- **Check app permissions** - camera and microphone access required
- **Update device OS** - older versions may not be supported

## Performance Issues

### App is slow or laggy
- **Close background apps** - free up device resources
- **Check device storage** - ensure adequate free space
- **Update device OS** - newer versions have better performance
- **Reduce video quality** - lower resolution for better performance

### High battery usage
- **Close unused apps** - background apps consume battery
- **Reduce screen brightness** - lower brightness saves battery
- **Check network usage** - poor connection causes retries
- **Use WiFi when possible** - mobile data uses more power

## Getting More Help

### Check the Logs
- Look at your terminal for error messages
- Check the Expo Go app for any error popups
- **Enable verbose logging** - add `--verbose` to expo start

### Common Solutions
1. **Restart everything** (app, terminal, computer)
2. **Clear cache** (`npx expo start --clear`)
3. **Reinstall dependencies** (`rm -rf node_modules && npm install`)
4. **Check your keys** (make sure `.env` file is correct)
