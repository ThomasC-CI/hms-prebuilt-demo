## Issues Found:

### 1. **BACKEND.md** - Outdated Type References
- References `CreateRoomRequest` which no longer exists (should be `CreateRoomOptions`)
- The example code shows a different interface than what's actually available

### 2. **INSTALLATION.md** - Environment Variables
- Lists `EXPO_PUBLIC_HMS_APP_ACCESS_KEY` but this isn't used in the current code
- Lists `HMS_APP_SECRET` and `HMS_JWT_SECRET` but these aren't used in the demo

### 3. **README.md** - Missing Dependencies
- The installation command is missing some required dependencies
- Doesn't mention that some dependencies need `--legacy-peer-deps`

### 4. **SECURITY.md** - References Non-existent Methods
- References `hmsService.getAuthToken()` which doesn't exist in the current service
