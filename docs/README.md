# Video Chat Demo App 🎥

An open-source React Native demo showing how to build a production-ready video chat application. This project demonstrates modern mobile development practices, secure API design, and scalable architecture.

## What This Project Demonstrates

This isn't just another video chat app - it's a **complete learning resource** for developers who want to understand:

- 🏗️ **Modern React Native architecture** with Expo
- 🔒 **Secure authentication patterns** for mobile apps
- 🌐 **Backend API design** with proper separation of concerns
- 📱 **Native mobile development** best practices
- 🚀 **Production deployment** strategies

### Current Features
- **Real-time video chat** with camera, microphone, and screen sharing
- **Cross-platform compatibility** (iOS & Android)
- **Room management system** with unique codes
- **Responsive UI** that works on all device sizes

### Production-Ready Architecture
- **Secure token-based authentication**
- **Scalable backend design**
- **Proper error handling** and user feedback
- **Performance optimization** for mobile devices

## Why This Project Exists

Building video chat from scratch is complex. Most tutorials show the basics but skip the hard parts:
- How to handle authentication securely
- How to design APIs that scale
- How to deploy mobile apps properly
- How to manage real-time connections

This project fills those gaps by showing **real-world implementation** rather than just theory.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- **Expo CLI** installed and configured
- **100ms account** (free tier available)
- **Node.js** for backend development

### 1. Get Your API Keys
- Sign up at [100ms.live](https://100ms.live) (free tier)
- Copy your **App Access Key** and **App Secret**
- Note your **Template ID**

### 2. Clone and Configure
```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd hms-prebuilt-demo
cp .env.example .env
```

Update `.env` with your credentials:
```bash
EXPO_PUBLIC_HMS_TEMPLATE_ID=your_template_id
EXPO_PUBLIC_HMS_APP_ACCESS_KEY=your_app_access_key
HMS_APP_SECRET=your_app_secret
```

### 3. Run the Demo
```bash
npm install
npx expo start
```

## Architecture Deep Dive

### Frontend (React Native + Expo)
- **Modern hooks-based** React components
- **TypeScript** for type safety
- **Responsive design** that works on all devices
- **State management** with React hooks

### Backend (Node.js + Express)
- **RESTful API design** following best practices
- **JWT authentication** with proper security
- **Rate limiting** and abuse prevention
- **Error handling** and logging

### Video Infrastructure (100ms)
- **WebRTC-based** real-time communication
- **Scalable architecture** that handles thousands of users
- **Cross-platform compatibility** (iOS, Android, Web)

## Learning Path

### Beginner Level
1. **Run the demo** - See how everything works together
2. **Explore the code** - Understand the component structure
3. **Modify the UI** - Change colors, add new features

### Intermediate Level
1. **Study the backend** - Learn API design patterns
2. **Understand authentication** - See how JWT tokens work
3. **Customize the video UI** - Modify the 100ms components

### Advanced Level
1. **Deploy your own backend** - Set up production infrastructure
2. **Add user management** - Implement user accounts and roles
3. **Scale the application** - Handle multiple rooms and users

## Version Compatibility

This project is built with current versions as of 2024:
- **100ms SDK**: v1.11.0 (API v2)
- **Expo SDK**: 53
- **React Native**: 0.79.6

The architectural patterns and security practices shown here are current and follow 100ms's latest recommendations. While the specific API calls may change in future versions, the underlying principles remain the same.

> 💡 **Note**: The concepts demonstrated here apply to any WebRTC provider, not just 100ms. We chose 100ms for its developer-friendly approach and generous free tier, but you can adapt these patterns to other services.
